        <p>Hello everyone!</p>
        <p class="indented spaced narrow">My name is Manuel Pacheco, and I am pursuing a career in Information Technology. While I am in the process of gaining professional experience in the IT field, this website showcases the skills and knowledge I’ve developed through my formal education at CSU Global.</p>

<p>In addition to the projects featured here, I have been working on building my own home network, and I plan to share pictures and videos of that setup as it evolves in the coming weeks and months. I'm also in the process of uploading several projects completed on Hack The Box, which highlight my hands-on experience in cybersecurity and networking.</p>

<p>You can download my resume in PDF format for more detailed information about my background and skills. This website was built using GitHub, and I encourage you to visit my GitHub page to explore the code. If you have any suggestions or ideas for improving my site, please feel free to share them—I'm always eager to learn new tips and techniques, particularly in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>

<p>Thank you for visiting, and I hope you enjoy exploring my work!</p>
