        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello everyone,</p>
        <p>My name is Manuel Pacheco and am currently pursuing a career in information technology, particularly in cyber security or forensics. Although I don't have work experience in IT, I decided to showcase some of the concepts learned in my formal education and training through CSU Global. Beyond some of the projects you'll find here, I also have been working on a home network which I hope to have pictures and some video of that network in the coming weeks/months as I build the network. With that, please feel free to visit my downloadable resume in PDF. In addition to my projects, this website was created using Github, so please feel free to visit my page and view the code! Of course if you see something that could help improve my website, by all means, please offer your ideas as I'm constantly learning tips and tricks when writing in html/css/java. Thank you again for visiting and hope you enjoy! </p>
